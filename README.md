# StereoCensus
Verilog Implementation of the census transform stereo vision algorithm

This is the code that was used in the paper "A parameterized stereo vision core 
for FPGAs" By Stephen Longfield and Mark Chang, published in FCCM09. Any
academic work derived from this code should cite that paper.
